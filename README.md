# DevOps Challenge (with GitHub & Azure)
This repo contains the assets required to run one of two different variants of the DevOps Challenge with GitHub and Azure. The **[first version](assets/boards-integration.md)** includes work management exercises using integration with Azure Boards. The **[second version](assets/github-only.md)** is condensed and doesn't include work item tracking. Aside from the presence of Azure Boards integration, thw two challenges are identical.
